# STK Integration: Using Python APIs 
Integration of Valispace with AGI STK
*This demo shows the preliminary integration of Valispace with AGI's Systems Tool Kit (STK) using python APIs. This tutorial requires an existing license for STK's Integration module. To get a license for STK's Integration module get an [evaluation license from AGI](http://licensing.agi.com/stk/evaluation) or contact [AGI support](https://support.agi.com/).*

Integration of STK with Valispace empowers space mission designers to realize the possibilities for automating and eliminating the gaps between your simulation software and mission data management. By integrating STK to Valispace, the simulation data and updates to mission at every design iteration are automatically updated in respective Valis and components, making it concurrently available to all the project members quickly.

This basic integration tutorial showcases basic two-way data exchange between STK and Valispace by automating building of a scenario automatically from mission data on Valispace.

**JSON.rar** - Valispace project import file
- Go to your project or create a new project and create a new blank component.
- Right Click on the component  and select import.
- Drop the JSON.rar package. You should have the project ready for integration.
- Drag the `Scenario` component out of the blank component and delete the blank component.
