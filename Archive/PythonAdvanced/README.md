# Valispace-STK Integration
## Leveraging advanced astrodynamics capability of STK Astrogator 

- The automated interfaces between mission data on Valispace and mission simulation in external tool like STK can be extrapolated to automate more complex and real design scenarios. An example of this advanced interface with state-of-the-art astrodynamics module 'Astrogator' from STK is shown in the video below. In the video below, a mission designer using STK to generate the spacecraft trajectory has automated interfaces between his STK node and the Valispace projects. In brief, 

	- A GEO satellite has to target a very specific and narrow GEO slot in the orbit, for a specific payload operation over a specific region. To target this, complex trajectory calculations are made for the transfer from a low earth parking orbit to a specific 'longitude' at GEO height.

	- Changes in the parking orbit due to launch change or various other reasons, forces a mission designer to recalculate every time. Following this, he has to manually update tens of parameters related to mission design, to the project database and make it available to other design teams.

	- Using STK+Valispace interface, we do this in a matter of a click :) and the data is available in the project database as soon as the STK application finishes its calculations.
	- Check out the video to see how we do it!
